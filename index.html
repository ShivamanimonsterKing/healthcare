                    <p>To prevent disease and maintain good health, it’s essential to practice proper hygiene by washing your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</p>
                    <p>Staying up-to-date with vaccinations is crucial, as they help prevent serious illnesses. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins supports your immune system, while staying hydrated is equally important. </p>
                    <p>Regular exercise enhances immune function, and managing a healthy weight can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, practicing safe food handling, limiting alcohol and tobacco use, and getting adequate sleep help protect against infections and long-term health issues</p>
                    <p> Stress management techniques like yoga or deep breathing exercises, along with regular health check-ups, are also vital. Avoiding close contact with sick individuals and maintaining a clean environment, including disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, further contribute to disease prevention.</p>
                    <p> By incorporating these habits into your daily life, you can strengthen your body’s defenses and reduce the risk of illness.</p>
